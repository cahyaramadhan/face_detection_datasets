# face_detection_datasets
The Positive Dataset was taken from http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html.
The Negative Datasets was taken from https://www.kaggle.com/prasunroy/natural-images and https://www.kaggle.com/koryakinp/fingers.

The datasets were used to train a Machine Learning model using Google Colab. (So it needs to be placed on Github to make things easier).

big_test_images was taken from Google Images.
